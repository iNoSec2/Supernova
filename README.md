## Features

Supernova offers automatic conversion of the encrypted shellcode into formats compatible with various programming languages, including:
- C
- C#
- Rust
- Nim
- Golang (Community request by [@_atsika](https://twitter.com/_atsika))

- PowerShell
- VBA (Implemented by [@verydamptowel](https://twitter.com/verydamptowel))
- Java
- Ruby
- Raw (Implemented by [@y2qaq](https://twitter.com/y2qaq))

Supports a variety of different ciphers, including:
- ROT
- XOR
- RC4
- AES (AES-128-CBC, AES-192-CBC, AES-256-CBC)
- Chacha20 (Implemented by [@y2qaq](https://twitter.com/y2qaq))

Supports various obfuscation techniques, which make the malicious shellcode appear as if it were:
- IPv4
- IPv6
- MAC
